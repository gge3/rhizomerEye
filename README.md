# Rhizomer

Rhizomer is a web application for interactive **exploration** of **semantic** and **linked data** available 
from **SPARQL** endpoints. With Rhizomer, lay users can explore datasets performing the **3 data analysis tasks**:

* **Overview**: _get the full picture of the data set at hand_
  * Rhizomer generates an overview of the kinds of things in a dataset using a **wordcloud**. 
    It is also possible to shown how things are related using a **network** overview.

* **Zoom & Filter**: _zoom in on items of interest and filter out uninteresting ones_
  * Once a class is selected, Rhizomer generates a **faceted view**.
    It zooms in and allows filtering resources of the chosen type based on their properties.
    Future work is to also allow pivoting among classes through facets.

* **Details**: _after zooming and filtering the user arrives at the resources of interest_
  * All **properties and values** are shown for the selected resource.
    It is also possible to **browse** linked resources.
    Future works it to include visualisations like maps or timelines.

## Install

It is also possible to deploy your own copy of Rhizomer. The source code is available from GitHub:

* **RhizomerEye**: frontend developed with Angular, source code available from https://github.com/rhizomik/rhizomerEye
* **RhizomerAPI**: backend developed using Spring, source code available from https://github.com/rhizomik/rhizomerAPI

There are also Docker images available from Docker Hub and a [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/rhizomik/rhizomerAPI/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) to deploy the backend and
another [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/rhizomik/rhizomerEye/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) for the frontend.
